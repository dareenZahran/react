# Welcome to the React Perfume Store

This project is the React Perfume Store, developed using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for an intuitive and engaging online perfume shopping experience.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you have access to the following scripts:

### `npm start`

This script runs the application in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload as you make changes to the code.\
Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Use this script to launch the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more details.

### `npm run build`

This script builds the application for production, optimizing it for the best performance.\
The production-ready app will be placed in the `build` folder.

The build is minified and file names include unique hashes for caching.\
Your app is now ready to be deployed!

For more deployment information, visit the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: Ejecting is a one-way operation!**

If unsatisfied with the build tool and configurations, you can `eject` at any time. This will remove the single build dependency from your project, copying all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) directly into your project for complete control.

You're free to modify the copied scripts but keep in mind that you're on your own from this point.

You're not obligated to use `eject`; the provided features cater to small and middle deployments. However, when you're ready for customization, it's available.
